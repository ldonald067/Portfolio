        <h3>User Survey</h3>
        <p>The results of the survey proved that although there are many competitors in the cloud storage industry, participants are still not 100% satisfied. There were a number of issues ranging from confusing UI to no real offline access. My survey highlights will focus on cloud storage users.</p>

                <p>Next I moved onto getting to know my competitors. My competitive analysis (SWOT analysis) focused on the top three companies that I based on my own research: Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">GoogleDrive</span> is the most popular due to its free plan offers the most space with 15GB. Furthermore, they have the most features and customizability. However, this is also their disadvantage as the UI can be confusing specifically in regards to the dashboard.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Dropbox</span> thrives off simplicity, but only offers 2GB free space. Also, you can upload and save files. There are some collaboration features as well, but you can not create content.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Onedrive</span> strengths and weakness are how compatible it is with Microsoft office 365. This can be seen as a weakness as non-Microsoft Office 365 users may not want to use OneDrive. It does not have the universal appeal as other cloud storage services have.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-12">
                <p>All 3 competitors are known for having specific or set of features. After taking into account of the survey results and the strengths plus weaknesses of the competitors I’ve decided that Stash should be known for organizing, creating, collaboration. </p>

                    <li>Finding the more options by clicking the checkbox is confusing</li>
                    <li>Too many sign-in options (i.e. Yahoo and Outlook) that are not popular like Google and/or Facebook</li>
                    <li>A user thought the Download button on the dashboard was to upload</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
                <p>Based on the feedback of the navigation pane, I need to get rid of the checkbox and change the layout of the homepage/onboarding experience. </p>

                <h3>Branding</h3>
                <p>In order to develop the concept, I did a mind map on “organize.”  This helped me come up with a name for the site “Stash” and generate various logo ideas.</p>
            </div>

                <p>2. <span class="bold">Logo iterations</span>. When I think of the word stash I automatically picture hiding something. Most of my rough first concepts revolved around an squirrel and acorn. I couldn’t resist myself by giving the moustache a shot. I definitely feel that the squirrel with the acorn is visually appealing and 100% conveys the idea of what cloud storage is.</p>
                <img src="images/top_5_stash_logos.jpg" />
                <p>3. <span class="bold">Style guide</span>. Including color palette and type choices for both logo and website. Hammersmith One seemed like a perfect fit for headlines, links, etc as it is bold. There is no need to make changes to it even a small size stands out with it boldness and unique hand brush feel. Since Hammetsmith is in your face and resembles sort of an amteur-ish look I wanted to counter that with something more elegant and non-intrusive such as Quattrocento Sans.</p>

                <h3>Hi-Fidelity Mockups and User Testing</h3>
                <p>While and after creating hi-fidelity mockups I went through various testing including usability and preference testing. The strongest feedback I received was that the spacing on the dashboard was too much,  the homepage/sign up section was confusing, and that the black backgroundat the bottom of the homepage felt out of place. Below is a recording of one usability test that was conducted after creating the first hi-fidelity mockups.</p>

                <h3>Onboard Iterations</h3>
                <h4>Version 1 (left), Version 2 (right), Final version (bottom)</h4>
                <p>Based off the feedback from participants, changes had to be made. The biggest change was making the sign up/sign in section more integrated and changing the top nav bar.</p>
                <p>1. This when the old logo was used. I wanted the user to be able to create an account on the homepage, one less click.</p>
                <p>2. The feedback I got from number indicated that there was too much of a disconnect in the hero section where it shares almost half the screen with the onboarding section. It’s difficult to know where the focus should be. Therefore, I made it so the onboarding section blends it with more with  the hero image and text. I also made the top nav bar a different color to help distinguish it more.</p>
                <p>3.With a no logo created that perfectly shows what Stash is I made it the centerpiece. When the user clicks to create a account, they will be take to a different screen to complete screen to complete the process.</p>

                <h4>Results from Onboarding preference testing</h4>
                <p>I conducted a preference test on the two different versions of the onboarding experience.</p>
                <p>85% picked option 2, there were 25 participants. They enjoyed that you could only sign up via email or Facebook as opposed to having more than two options. The top nav bar was also favorable as it distinguishes itself from the rest of the page and the logo sticks out more.</p>

                <h3>Dashboard Iterations</h3>
                <h4>Version 1 (left), Version 2 (right), Final version (bottom)</h4>
                <p>1. Using Figma, I applied my chosen Typeface and Color Palette to my Wireframes.</p>
                <p>2.  The biggest change I made with the second version was removing the unnecessary space. There is more color variation here which makes it stand out from the first version. Also, the white background along with the gray nav left bar made the first version still feel more like a wireframe. Finally, I removed the buttons on the right as they could cause distraction and made combined into a new button “Add”.  Ultimately. the focus should be where the content is and the left nav bar. That is what I was hoping to accomplish with this version</p>
                <p>3.  The second version was definitely an improvement, but more still had to be done. The top buttons still seemed too distracting and the sign out button looked out of place. I was also starting to feel like the grey background still gave off a lo-fi wireframe feeling. In the third and final version I turned the buttons into icons and, made the dashboard background white, removed the sign out button, and changed the color of the left nav bar to a brighter blue. This version looks more clean and although simple, it still is nice to look at.</p>

                <h4>Results from Dashboard preference testing</h4>
                <p>93% of 25 participants picked version 3. The color variations helped version 1 stand out more. The white background in number 2 along with the gray nav left bar makes it still feel more like a wireframe. I also made the buttons smaller in number 1 which I think helped as it put less focus on theme. The main focuses should be where the content is and the left nav bar.</p>

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>The cloud storage market is becoming more relevant as technology users are getting accustomed to having everything in one place. It is a competitive market indeed. However, the current products are either too simple with no unique features or have too many features/confusing UI. More importantly, none of them can be accessed offline.</p>
                <p>This is where Stash comes in! Looking to make a cloud storage product that is seamless. We want users to be able to navigate through everything from the sign up process to the dashboard with easy. Stash is hope to offer features that will differentiate us from our competitors such as real time chat with other members of shared files, tags, etc. On top of that we will offer top-notch security.</p>
